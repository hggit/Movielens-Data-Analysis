Analysis of IMDB movie ratings.
The research question that this project aims to answer is that what are the characteristics(genres and tags) that are generally associated with highly rated movies. The goal is to use those genres and tags as filters to extract a select list of movies which has a much higher percentage of highly rated movies than the original list from the dataset.
